# Pierre's Vendors

#### C# practice for Epicodus, 07.24.2020

## By Jeff Kim

## Description

Pierre's business has been booming and, like any entrepreneur with an influx of customers, he needs a way to keep track of his vendors and orders. Luckily for Pierre, we can create a handy web interface that he can work with - no technical skills required!

This project uses C# and MVC to create a web interface that will allow Pierre to add vendors and keep track of each vendor's orders. Pierre will be able to add orders in each vendor's details page and make sure that those orders belong to those specific vendors. He can then view the details of the order, including the price that he should be paid, by clicking the order title from the list.
